### Hi there 👋

Here you'll mostly find old code projects that I have created in the past. Likely the project is in an unfinished state as my mind likes to run a mile a minute and jump from one personal project to another 😁
Feel free to poke around but note the date of the last commit for the repo and keep in mind that my code is a lot different now than it was. Most of my old stuff makes me cringe but I like to see the progression over time 😄
